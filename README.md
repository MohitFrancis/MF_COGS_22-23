# MF_COGS_22-23
## COGS Coding Assignments and Projects

This repository is used solely to store selected academic work from my time at the Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS), which I attended from 2022 to 2023.

The folders starting with 'MF_' are bigger assignments or projects. The work contained in 'Other' are smaller projects.

For educational and demonstrative purposes only.
