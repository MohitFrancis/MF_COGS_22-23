Their challenges primarily revolve around tidying the data set of the week – usually collected from open-source repositories; mined by data-science enthusiasts; or provided by researchers. However, further analysis of the data is recommended as an additional learning exercise for beginner data scientists.\n",

    "[Numbats (*Myrmecobius fasciatus*)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/6c72d199-f0f1-44d3-8197-224a2f7cff5f#cite_note-iucn_status_12_November_2021-1) are insectivorous marsupials indigenous to Australia, subsisting on a diet consisting almost entirely of termites. They were once widely distributed across southern and Western Australia, but their numbers declined significantly due to non-native feral predators such as the European red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) and the domestic cat (*Felis catus*). Estimates suggest there are fewer than 1000 numbat individuals in the wild and in zoos, meaning numbats are considered endangered species. Recent efforts to reintroduce them into their former habitats have seen some success, but continued success is dependant on whether numbats are protected from their introduced predators."

    "Numbats (*Myrmecobius fasciatus*) are marsupials indigenous to Australia. Currently numbats are concentrated in protected areas in Western Australia, Southern Australia and New South Wales. However, their historical range was much larger, covering almost all of Southwestern Australia. Their numbers declined significantly due to invasive predators such as the European red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) and the domestic cat (*Felis catus*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbats are more frequently observed during the warmer months of the Spring, Summer and early Autumn. During the late Spring, numbats are raising their young, and during Winter, they enter hibernation, which may explain why they are less visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbats are sighted more on weekdays (more often on Mondays) than on weekends, though the number of observations per day is relatively even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbats are diurnal, meaning they are commonly found during daytime, when their meal of preference - termites - are most active.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbats are sighted more on dry days with an average maximum tempature of 22 degrees Celsius and an average minimum temperature of 8 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are fewer than 1000 numbat individuals in the wild and in zoos, meaning numbats are considered endangered species. Recent efforts to reintroduce them into their former habitats have seen some success. Hopefully the population of numbats in Australia can bounce back."
